I can't go to school tomorrow because I shouldn't need it. I'm very inteligent and I'll be very pretty. I'd a really cool thing to do as well so it's kinda complicated to leave home. I won't do it no worries they mustn't get me. Today, something really good has happened. What's happened? You ask. Well, I feel really good about it. It's got me by surprise at first and I didn't know what to do, but now I do and with time I'll do it. I've got to think how to do it however. I wanted to have done it already, but this things need a carefull aproach. Sometimes really carefull and really time consuming.
When you need to go somewhere you call a cab.
I can go to school, but I don't want to do it because I should not need it. I will leave this stuff behind.
I would travel more if I could but I do like you.
